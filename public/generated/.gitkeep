# Generated Images

This folder contains AI-generated icons created by the Uniicon Adobe Express add-on.

Images are automatically saved here when generated through the multi-agent AI pipeline.

## File Naming Convention

Files are named using the pattern:
`generated-[description]-[timestamp].png`

Where:
- `description` is the cleaned user input
- `timestamp` is the ISO timestamp when generated

## Storage

- Generated images are served at `/generated/[filename]`
- Images are automatically cleaned up after 24 hours (optional)
- Maximum storage: 100MB (recommended)
